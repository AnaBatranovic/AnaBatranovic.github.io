My name is Ana (surprise!), I'm currently a highschool student based in Serbia. I've been interested in tech for as long as I remember, starting with web development and eventually discovering cybersecurity, which I ðŸ’œ. 

I have a couple of side-projects that are WIP, the biggest one being a bee-spy game, which I'm collaborating on with an amazing artist friend. I also have a small addiction to CTFs, but that's neither here nor there. My other hobbies include musicals and books.

I'm a strong believer in inclusivity and accessibility. I believe everyone should have equal opportunity, no matter their background. Lack of equity is a big problem in the tech industry, and I hope to do my part to make tech spaces as open and welcoming as possible.
